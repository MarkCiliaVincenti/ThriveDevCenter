        <h4>Trusted Builds</h4>
        <p>
            These devbuilds are created from each commit in the official Thrive repository, and are safe as long as the
            repository security is not compromised.

        <h4>Untrusted Builds</h4>
        <p>
            These devbuilds have been uploaded without authentication. As such these files should not be trusted without
            scrutiny. For example pull requests from people outside the team show up here. The verified column says
            true, when a Thrive developer has verified the build.
